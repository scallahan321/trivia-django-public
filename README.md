 This is the back end for my trivia game. I used Django Rest Framework to build an API that is accessed by the React front end. 
 
 The back end makes calls to the Open Trivia DB API (https://opentdb.com/) for content. 

 Users can login, select a category, and play 10 question rounds of trivia. The user info and stats are saved in a Heroku postgres database.
 
 The app is live here - [https://seans-trivia-game.herokuapp.com/](https://seans-trivia-game.herokuapp.com/)
